# Production overrides for Docker Compose
# Usage: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
#
# Production Configuration:
#   - Increased buffer pool size (5000 pages = ~20MB) for better performance
#   - Increased document cache (5000 docs) for high-read workloads
#   - Resource limits to prevent runaway processes
#   - Structured logging with rotation
